			<p>The Sun—the heart of our solar system—is a yellow dwarf star, a hot ball of glowing gases.
			Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest particles of debris in its orbit. Electric currents in the Sun generate a magnetic field that is carried out through the solar system by the solar wind—a stream of electrically charged gas blowing outward from the Sun in all directions.
			The connection and interactions between the Sun and Earth drive the seasons, ocean currents, weather, climate, radiation belts and aurorae. Though it is special to us, there are billions of stars like our Sun scattered across the Milky Way galaxy.</p>

			<p>The celestial neighborhood also contains the Alpha Centauri system. It comprises the closest set of stars, even if their light does take just over four years to reach us. There are actually three all doing a complex orbital dance together.
			The primaries in the system, Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B, are about 4.37 light-years from Earth. A third star, Proxima Centauri (sometimes called Alpha Centauri C), is gravitationally associated with the former. It's actually slightly closer to Earth at 4.24 light-years away.</p>

			<p>The next closest star is a faint red dwarf about 5.96 light-years from Earth. It's called Barnard's Star, after American astronomer E.E. Barnard. It was once hoped that it might contain planets around it, and astronomers made many attempts to try and spot them. 
			Unfortunately, it appears to have none. Astronomers will keep looking, of course, but it doesn't seem too likely that it contains planetary neighbors. Barnard's star is located in the direction of the constellation Ophiuchus.</p>

			<p>Here's an interesting bit of trivia about this star: it was the location of an epic battle on the television series "Star Trek: The Next Generation," where the cyborg-human Borg race and the Federation fought for control of the galaxy. 
			Most Trekkies know the name of this star and what it means to the Trekiverse. 
			In reality, Wolf 359 is located only 7.78 light-years from Earth. It looks pretty dim to observers.
			In fact, to be able to see it, they have to use telescopes. It's not visible to the naked eye. That's because Wolf 359 is a faint red dwarf star. It's located in the direction of the constellation Leo.</p>

			<p>Located in the constellation Ursa Major, Lalande 21185 is a faint red dwarf that, like many of the stars in this list, is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. However, that hasn't kept astronomers from studying it.
			That's because it may well have planets orbiting it. Understanding its planetary system would give more clues to how such worlds form and evolve around older stars. This star is named for the 19th-century French astronomer Joseph Jérôme Lefrançois de Lalande. 
			As close as it is at a distance of 8.29 light-years, it is not likely that humans will travel to Lalande 21185 any time soon. Still, astronomers will keep checking on possible worlds and their habitability for life.</p>

			<p>Nearly everyone knows about Sirius. It's the brightest star in our night sky and has been, at times in our history, used as a harbinger of planting by the Egyptians, and a predictor of seasonal change by other civilizations.
			Sirius is actually a binary star system containing Sirius A and Sirius B and lies 8.58 light-years from Earth in the constellation Canis Major. 
			It is known more commonly as the Dog Star. Sirius B is a white dwarf, a celestial object that will be left behind once our Sun reaches the end of its life. </p>

			<p>Located in the constellation Cetus, this binary star system is 8.73 light-years from Earth. It is also known as Gliese 65 and is a binary star system. 
			One of the members of the system is a flare star and it varies in brightness over time. The star is named for Willem Jacob Luyten, who helped determine its proper motion. </p>
